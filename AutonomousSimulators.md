# CARLA - “Open Source Simulator for Autonomous Driving Research”
* https://carla.org/
* Version 0.9.9 released on April 22, 2020
* “CARLA has been developed from the ground up to support development, training, and validation of autonomous driving systems. In addition to open-source code and protocols, CARLA provides open digital assets (urban layouts, buildings, vehicles) that were created for this purpose and can be used freely. The simulation platform supports flexible specification of sensor suites, environmental conditions, full control of all static and dynamic actors, maps generation and much more.”

# Udacity Self Driving Car Simulation
* https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim
* Simulator for the Udacity “SELF-DRIVING CAR ENGINEER NANODEGREE PROGRAM”
* Udacity would probably not like to see this “stolen”, but not sure what kind of rights they have to the simulation

# Metamoto
* https://www.metamoto.com/
* “Enterprise products and services for massively scalable, safe, scenario-based training and testing of autonomous systems software”
* I highly recommend checking this one out, the presentation is the best of what I’ve seen so far

# Voyage Deepdrive
* https://deepdrive.voyage.auto/
* “Voyage Deepdrive is a simulator that allows anyone with a PC to push the state-of-the-art in self-driving”
* Has a cool Leaderboard section that keeps track of whose self-driving system is able to best complete a certain task .

# Microsoft’s Aerial Informatics and Robotics Platform
* https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/aerial-informatics-robotics-platform/
* “Microsoft AirSim (Aerial Informatics and Robotics Simulation) is an open-source robotics simulation platform. From ground vehicles, wheeled robotics, aerial drones, and even static IoT devices, AirSim can capture data for models without costly field operations.”
* First one I’ve seen to specifically feature something other than a self-driving car (a drone in this case)
